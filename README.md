# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values.  The `$in` operator is designed to match documents where the specified field exists and its value is one of the values within the provided array. However, when a `null` is present in the array, the behavior may not align with expectations.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file contains a query that attempts to use the `$in` operator with an array including `null`. This can lead to unexpected results, as the `null` value can affect the query's outcome in a way that might not be immediately apparent. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows a corrected approach. Instead of directly including `null` in the array, one should check for `null` explicitly or use other appropriate approaches depending on the logic required.
